It was a little complicated to change the structure of the plist after already writing the code with a different structure of plist. It is important to structure out the data before jumping in to write the code. Makes life a lot easier that ways. Also it was complex to understand how to fetch exact data form the structure ie how to get the index 0 from the array stored under a particular key value in. I just wish plists were a little easier to deal with. \
